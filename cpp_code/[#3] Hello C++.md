# Introduction
- Hello C++!
- Why C++?
- - popularity : Python >> R > C/C++
- - We want to be armed with various tools! for various situations
- Python(R)
- - Automation : easy -> dynamically typed, memory management // Inefficiency
- - Interpreted language : line by line to the computer... easy for debugging! // Slow Speed (interpretation each time...)
- - many libraries
- - Possible runtime error
- C/C++
- - Controllability : can optimize // hard, no garbage collection(?) 쓰레기 알아서 치워라
- - Compiled language : fast // less flexible -> machine specific compiling 실행 안될 수도
- Speed matters in Data Science!! And you can encounter situations where your own customized code is needed!
- You need to read C/C++ code
- Python(R) for prototyping and C/C++ for speed
- - See the python code "C++ vs Python.ipynb" for visualization
